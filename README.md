## Problem Statement and Solution Approach

In today's remote work environment, team collaboration often suffers from fragmented tools and disconnected workflows. Video calls lack context, document sharing is cumbersome, and productivity tools don't integrate well with real-time communication.

Maestro solves this by providing a unified platform that combines:
- LiveKit-powered HD video conferencing
- AI-assisted meeting insights and action items
- Real-time collaborative document editing
- Intelligent meeting summarization and transcription

The platform is built on Next.js for optimal performance and uses LiveKit's WebRTC infrastructure for reliable, low-latency video communication.
